# Privacy Preserving P2P AI

Fully private, verifiable, pay-per-use AI inference network.
Users can query AI models without revealing their identity, IP, prompt, or usage patterns.
Inference providers run models inside Oasis ROFL Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), proving correct execution while remaining anonymous.

All communication happens over Waku, ensuring metadata-free routing, and payment is handled via x402, enabling trustless and automatic monetization for inference providers.
Models and encrypted logs are stored via Filecoin Onchain Cloud, giving the system censorship resistance and sovereign data ownership.

This project demonstrates a sovereign, institution-grade, privacy-preserving AI stack.
